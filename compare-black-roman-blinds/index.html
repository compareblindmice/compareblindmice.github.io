                    The faux suede in black offers a more luxurious take on monochromatic minimalism, with its lightweight, soft-feel fabric and jet black hue, and the suppleness of the cloth means it folds gorgeously into neat roman pleats. The stark shade of the black will look stunning against white walls and lime soft furnishings in a contemporary living room or home office. Keep furniture to clean, modern lines and scatter splashes of lime throughout the room. Alternatively, try with another hue, such as cobalt blue or marigold orange.Please note: roman blinds over 130cm wide require vertical seams due to limited fabric width. We recommended you split large windows into smaller blinds.
