                Rimini, Dove - Roller Blind (247blinds)
                </h3></a><p class="sf-product-card-horizontal__description desktop-only truncate-overflow" data-v-6273ffba>
                    The rich simplicity of the rimini in dove is all you need for any room. Neither dark nor light, it allows just a little light to penetrate, and provides you with the privacy you need, when you need it. And this resilient, quality blind will last you well, year upon year. There aren't many colours or styles that the moderating monochrome of the dove won't work with. Set off bright reds, complement deep purples, or tame dazzling limes.

                Rimini, Almond - Roller Blind (247blinds)
                </h3></a><p class="sf-product-card-horizontal__description desktop-only truncate-overflow" data-v-6273ffba>
                    The rimini almond is a classic, creamy white offering that's sure to add a touch of elegance to any room. Its fine texture makes it soft to the touch, yet it retains the durability typical of the rimini range. Combine with bold patterns for effortless period chic, or with browns, beiges, and golds for a modern, opulent look. The almond's luxurious finish will particularly suit a living room or bedroom where relaxing is the main goal, but of course would work well in any room amongst most colour schemes.

                Rimini (Blackout), Cream - Roller Blind (247blinds)
                </h3></a><p class="sf-product-card-horizontal__description desktop-only truncate-overflow" data-v-6273ffba>
                    Who'd have thought that a beautiful cream blind could work as a blackout blind? Well, the rimini (blackout) in cream does exactly that, all while offering its creamy paleness to any window. Perfect for the bedroom or home office, this shade works wonderfully with vintage floral patterns, bold bright blues and greens, or dark, moody browns and greys. It fits equally well in a neutrally decorated room full of beiges and golds, or a pastel colour scheme full of pale pinks, dusky lilacs, or baby blues.

                    If there's one addition to their trinity blackout range that we fell in love with the moment we set eyes on it then it's their oyster grey fabric. Stone greys are very much on-trend this season, and oyster allows you to gently work in one of the most popular shades whilst also breathing new life into your decor. We love the idea of combining oyster grey with simple natural tones and textures that allow the beauty of nature to come to the fore.

                    Trinity (blackout) black smoke is a colour that you perhaps don't expect to find all that often, but it's certainly a welcome surprise when you find it staring right back at you. The beauty of the washed blue is that it clearly sits atop a foundation of light grey that gives it a natural stone-like quality. This is a fabric that has 'versatility' as its middle name, so why not embrace the new creative avenues that it opens? It's all about allowing your individuality to run free so that you can really put your own stamp on things.

It will only be your indoors light that gets to it though, as this powerful blackout blind is every bit as effective as you'd hope at keeping outside light disturbances out. Team with rich creams and the subtlest of golds in a modern, luxurious kitchen, for which the wipe-clean fabric makes it perfect.

                    Cream focuses on celebrating the interplay between ambient light and finely woven fabric. The subtle variations in thickness and spacing of the mesh give the fabric a life of its own that provides an extra layer of depth for your eye to explore. Use cream where you want to break up a simple monotone surface by adding a little bit of texture that won't come to the fore in the same way that an eye-catching floral pattern would.
