This tight woven plain fabric has a self coloured pvc backing which prevents any light filtering through - perfect for blocking out the light on those early summer mornings or helping night workers to get to sleep. Our skylight blinds are ideal for your velux, fakro, rooflite and dakstra windows - all you need to do is choose a design and confirm your window manufacturer and window code (please note that these blinds are not manufactured by velux).
