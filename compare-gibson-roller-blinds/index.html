                    The gibson perfect white is a beautiful blind that gives a bright and airy feel even when closed. A solid colour fabric, it works brilliantly in smaller rooms as the pale colouration visually extends the space. Designed to suit damp conditions, the blind's hardwearing fabric is wipe-clean and fire retardant, so it can work in tricky spaces such as bathrooms and kitchens. Choose to have controls on either the left or right according to what best suits your layout. Looking for something a little stronger? This fabric is fully waterproof so can withstand a full drenching without any issues. Ideal for installing in a bathroom or right next to the shower. Being fully blackout this fabric is perfect for privacy as it will prevent any light from passing through the material. All of their blinds are sold with built-in child safety mechanisms. We adhere to the guidelines set out by the british blind and shutter association and take safety extremely seriously. All blinds come with the relevant child safety instructions and warnings. Please ensure you follow the provided instructions and warnings carefully. Please visit www.Makeitsafe.Org.Uk to find out more. All control chains supplied with their roller blinds will be approximately half the length of the drop. If you require a longer control chain, please get in touch once ordered and we can amend this for you.
