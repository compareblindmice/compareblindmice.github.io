                    Do you have trouble sleeping with nighttime lights and summertime sun? The rimini (blackout) range is specially designed to shield against harsh glares and unwanted light for a good night's sleep or day's relaxation, and this simple white edition does it with refined and classy style. Whilst the white will provide a refreshing lift to any surrounding, try balancing with a soothing lemon or muted lime walls for energising colour contrast.

                </h3></a><p class="sf-product-card-horizontal__description desktop-only truncate-overflow" data-v-6273ffba>
                    Trinity blackout vanilla allows you to add that subtle and refined touch of style to your home that it can be so hard to pin down. It's a gentle blend of cream and beige that sits elegantly in the background, giving your other colours the freedom to come to the fore and catch the eye. If you want to add something elegant and understated to the master bedroom then try combining vanilla with a matching rug atop a laminate floor.

                    White might not be your first instinct when looking for a blackout blind, but don't rule out the palermo (blackout) white just because of its colour. When it comes to keeping out harmful and distracting uv rays, this blind comes top of the class. The wipe-clean fabric of the palermo range makes this the perfect choice for kitchen windows, and will really gleam paired with colourful patterns and light wood worktops.

                    The ajanta (blackout) in pure is more than simply a white blackout blind. The silvery white background shimmers as the light hits it, and is pleasantly interrupted by the abstract white patterning, making this the perfect blind for adding a little magic to your home. The clean freshness of the pure is perfect for a bathroom, and will look great surrounded by turquoises, whites, and silvers. Or try it in the utility room or cloakroom to provide a touch of icy white sparkle to the room.

                    The beautiful white and shimmering accents of the splash (blackout) pure work together to create a pretty and clean blackout blind. A generous and wipe-clean fabric carries this attractive pattern, and is easily rolled and unrolled at leisure. Use the pure in the bathroom for a fresh and spotless look, and complement with silver fixtures and fittings, adding in the occasional splash of blue or turquoise if bold colours are your preference.

                    The pure white of the capri (blackout) pure is complemented perfectly by the hints of silver in its delicate pattern. Totally undistinguishable as a blackout blind, due to its pretty style and light colour, the pure is nonetheless incredibly competent when it comes to keeping unwanted light out of your home. The pure would suit a clean, fresh, and contemporary kitchen, with white units and silver accessories to bring out its colour, and would also work as a stylish feature in an otherwise plain utility room or downstairs cloakroom.
