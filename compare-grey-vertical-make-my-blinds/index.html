                    The burst grey mist vertical blind is a brilliant grey colour. The fabric has a slight texture to it and as it is a dimout material this helps to gently filter the light passing through it. This light grey colour is great for neutral coloured homes or offices. Keep your blinds looking their best with this easy to wipe clean fabric, just use a damp cloth to wipe away any dirt or stains. This blind can be made upto 400cm wide - much wider than all other blinds on the market so that you can cover your largest window without comprimising on style.

                    The burst graphite is true to the name as very deep grey-blue colour. The dark tone of this blind is one that works best as a contrast to lighter interiors but could be used in a room of rich browns, reds and gold colours. Be aware that this is a dark toned fabric and can easily be overbearing in the wrong room. Ideal for bathrooms and kitchens, this is a dimout fabric which will filter the light entering your room.

                    Firm and unyielding, the burst shark grey stands its ground in the window, keeping you safe from peeking eyes and burning sunlight. With such a dark neutral colour, we highly recommend pairing it with a brighter decor, preferably pastel primary colours that add an accent but don't try to beat the rock in a contest of strength, which they would most likely lose. Alternatively, used it to bridge a monochromatic scheme and take the edge out of the white/black contrast.

                    The light burst polished stone is on the paler side of grey. This is on the subtle side and would look great against a darker decor. The lighter grey will help enhance and lift the room. Use this across your home as the dimout fabric will gently filter the light, giving your room a warming glow. Keep your blinds looking their best with this easy to wipe clean fabric, just use a damp cloth to wipe away any dirt or stains.

                    Ambiguity is the keyword with the washed pebble. It is so ambiguous we genuinely have no idea what colour it is. Somewhere on the grey/beige spectrum, it seems to sit around halfway giving it the remarkable ability to blend with a variety of decor styles. Placed amongst bolder colours like blues, reds or yellows, it acts to calm them down and make the room less overwhelming, whereas placing it with more earthy tones gives the room a neutral accent that sticks with grabs your attention.
