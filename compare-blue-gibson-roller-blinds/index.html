                    The rich, teal blue coloured gibson persian blue would work brilliantly against a neutral background to help highlight the colour in this blind. This is a beautiful colour and great for anyone looking for a teal roller blind.

This fabric is fully waterproof so can withstand a full drenching without any issues. Ideal for installing in a bathroom or right next to the shower. Being fully blackout this fabric is perfect for privacy as it will prevent any light from passing through the material. All of their blinds are sold with built-in child safety mechanisms. We adhere to the guidelines set out by the british blind and shutter association and take safety extremely seriously. All blinds come with the relevant child safety instructions and warnings. Please ensure you follow the provided instructions and warnings carefully. Please visit www.Makeitsafe.Org.Uk to find out more.
