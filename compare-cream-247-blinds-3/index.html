                Windsor, Sandstone - Roman Blind (247blinds)
                </h3></a><p class="sf-product-card-horizontal__description desktop-only truncate-overflow" data-v-09c72102>
                    A gently shimmering pale gold, emphasised by the satin-feel fabric, the windsor sandstone is a blind of class and elegance. The silky cloth works wonderfully as a roman blind, easily falling into folds, and complementing the gentle curves. Craft a look of understated glamour in your living room by grouping the sandstone with cream walls and soft furnishings, wood-look tongue and groove flooring, and brushed gold oddments and accessories.

                    A sweet and sumptuous blind, mixing contrasting feelings of purity and grandeur, the windsor ivory incorporates pale, luxurious white and blends it with a silky smooth, lightweight fabric, all falling together into the gentle curves of the roman style. Keep your bedroom light and airy, with a touch of luxe, by hanging the ivory amongst pale pink or mint green walls, and accenting throughout the room with a darker version of your chosen colour.

                    With its beautifully textured look, in blueish slate and delicate silver, the nightshade blue grey grain is contemporary, stylish, and unusual. Add to this the hidden controls, sleek rail cassette, and sliding strips for light and privacy control, and you have the ultimate luxury blind. Treat the blue grey grain as a standalone window feature, setting it against pure white walls in the kitchen. Stick to white for the tiling and choose chrome units, accenting throughout with matching greys and whites for the most modernly chic look.

                    Form a contemporary look with the eye-catching pattern and alluring shades of the morrison in dove, where a grouping of slate and dove greys create a distinctive and imaginative print on a nimble and relaxed cloth for chic style with little effort. Combine the soothing tones of the dove with a similar base of subdued grey or white, accenting the striking print with alike designs and contrasting charcoal oddments.

                    The unique xerxes ivory features an array of creatures in browns, biscuits, and teals, all on a patterned background of cream and matte gold. The look is absolutely inspired and, of course, unusual, so you can be sure of this attractive roman blind being a real conversation piece. Bring out the teal tone of the blind by making it your dining room's key colour. Go for a feature wall of teal, opting for creamy white on the rest of the walls.

                    Take a closer look at astral ivory and you come to appreciate the subtle way in which the leaves twist and turn across the fabric. They have an elegant and timeless feel to them - one which will add depth and clarity to your decor like never before. If you want to introduce a spark of creative inspiration to the dining room, combine ivory with some dark tableware and wall art to provide a strong contrast.

                    Give your home a touch of the crisp modern aesthetic with origin cream. A finely woven voile serves as the perfect companion for the rich creamy fabric which sits underneath and allows you to subtly adjust the light levels to frame your room exactly how the occasion requires. Cream adds a homely quality to your decor that allows you to introduce anything from a light washed out blue to a gentle stone grey as you craft a relaxing atmosphere to savour.

                    The pretty, neutral patterning of the feather in dove showcases an understated style of dcor that will look at home in any kind of setting. Combining a pale creamy oatmeal background with a neutral grey for the illustrations, the look is subtle yet powerful. Surround the dove with alike cool neutrals, including soft cream walls, and pale grey tones to accentuate the light and airy look of the blind.

                Nightshade, Brown Grain - Day Night Blind (247blinds)
                </h3></a><p class="sf-product-card-horizontal__description desktop-only truncate-overflow" data-v-09c72102>
                    Who knew that neat, intricate stitching could offer such a delightful wood look? The nightshade in brown grain does just that, with chocolate and taupe threads forming a textured aesthetic and working perfectly with the translucent netting that slides between them for flexible light and privacy. Due to the wood-effect fabric, the brown grain will match any number of dcor schemes. Why not embrace the brown and pair with matching chocolate tones and a vibrant lime green? This look would work fantastically in a garden-view living room to match the colours of the outdoors.

It's absolutely perfect for a home with a vintage style, whether traditional or contemporary. The cream will look fantastic in a master bedroom, placed amongst luxe creams and plush fabrics. Pick out the pink tone in the blind to use as an accent colour, keeping the remainder of the room neutral yet luxurious.
