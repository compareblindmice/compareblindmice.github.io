                Rimini, Rose - Roller Blind (247blinds)
                </h3></a><p class="sf-product-card-horizontal__description desktop-only truncate-overflow" data-v-09c72102>
                    The pretty vintage of the rimini rose provides a strikingly elegant look, its dusky pink hue giving any room a warm, rosy glow. The long-lasting, resilient fabric has a smooth, effortless finish, allowing light to gently penetrate through. This blind is perfect for country chic designed rooms where it will be surrounded by cute florals and rich creams. Lovely in a bloom-filled bedroom, a light and airy hallway, or a rustic kitchen, this colour will go well with pale neutrals and country greens.

                Roma, Rose Tint - Roller Blind (247blinds)
                </h3></a><p class="sf-product-card-horizontal__description desktop-only truncate-overflow" data-v-09c72102>
                    The roma rose tint is as dusky as it is pretty, and its smoky overtones give this pink blind an extra level of style. Roma's simple fabric hangs flawlessly and without fuss, allowing all your focus to be on the attractive pink tone. Team the rose tint with stark whites to add a contemporary feel to this vintage tone. Bright white walls will make the colour pop, whilst this lovely colour scheme will feel relaxed and cheery in a bedroom, living room, or even kitchen.

                Roma, Primrose - Roller Blind (247blinds)
                </h3></a><p class="sf-product-card-horizontal__description desktop-only truncate-overflow" data-v-09c72102>
                    True to its name, the roma primrose is a soft and pretty yellow, steering away from less delicate lemons and mustards into a more subtle and delicate piece. The sweetness of the shade hides a strong and sturdy fabric, useful for the hustle and bustle of busy family life. Go for an unusual but attractive colour scheme in the bathroom by opting for soft yellows and off-whites rather than the usual blues and teals.

                Roma, Tuscan Rose - Roller Blind (247blinds)
                </h3></a><p class="sf-product-card-horizontal__description desktop-only truncate-overflow" data-v-09c72102>
                    The roma tuscan rose couldn't be better named. Its dusky pink tone is as warm as it is pretty, and the vintage look will appeal to many different tastes. The papery feel of the roma fabric is pleasant to touch, though the material itself is strong and durable. Give a delicate look to a traditional dining room, pairing the tuscan rose with dark, polished woods and palest pink walls. This look would also work well in a guest or master bedroom, or even in the living room for a relaxing atmosphere.

Make the flamingo stand out by placing in a white bathroom or kitchen, with only colour-coordinated accessories to accent the deep pink colour. Or use in a child's bedroom, amongst baby pinks, soft whites, and contemporary florals.
