                    Cellular pleated blinds are given their namesake because their 'celluar shade' is made of layers bonded together to creae honey-comb shaped pockets which trap air inside and limit heat transfer from the window. These pockets create the attractive pleating effect on the front and slow down the heat loss in your room. If you're looking for energy efficient blinds, celluar pleated blinds are effective at keeping your house warm during the winter and cool during the summer.

                    Cellular pleated blinds are given their namesake because their 'celluar shade' is made of layers bonded together to creae honey-comb shaped pockets which trap air inside and limit heat transfer from the window. These pockets create the attractive pleating effect on the front and slow down the heat loss in your room. If you're looking for energy efficient blinds, celluar pleated blinds are effective at keeping your house warm during the winter and cool during the summer.
