                </h3></a><p class="sf-product-card-horizontal__description desktop-only truncate-overflow" data-v-338237a7>
                    This roma is natural by name, and natural by nature. This creamy off-white shade will allow plenty of light to penetrate through into the room, while still offering plenty of privacy when needed, meaning that you could have this blind closed all the time if need be. An excellent choice for rooms needing both privacy and light, such as a bathroom or bedroom, this shade will match pretty much any colour scheme.

                Roma, Natural - Vertical Blind (247blinds)
                </h3></a><p class="sf-product-card-horizontal__description desktop-only truncate-overflow" data-v-338237a7>
                    The roma in natural is just a whisper of a cream, with a finely woven fabric and a gentle, natural hue. An effective filter blind, this is the model of class, style, and neutrality. The natural will work as part of almost any colour scheme, being particularly suited to clean, fresh rooms full of soft pastels, such as pinks or blues - the perfect colour scheme for a nursery or child's bedroom. Or hang it in the living room amongst country greens and fresh, dainty florals, for a charmingly rustic feel with a contemporary twist.

                    The natural is the lightest of their wood effect range, and will match almost any colour scheme. It combines a classically light wood effect with the sturdy toughness of heavy gauge aluminium, resulting in a modern and stylish look. The unobtrusive wood-look of the natural will match almost any colour palette. Use amongst pastels in a light and airy dining room; with forest greens in a statement dining room; or with fuchsia pinks in a teenager's bedroom.

                </h3></a><p class="sf-product-card-horizontal__description desktop-only truncate-overflow" data-v-338237a7>
                    In the palest of apricot golds, the faux silk in natural sits on a pretty and delicate fabric, scattered with lines of raised stitching to add texture and depth. The slight and dainty cloth works easily into the sumptuous roman curves, outlaying soft and cloud-like feel. Convert a plain bedroom into a utopia of dreamy elegance by alloying the natural to a scheme of golds and pinks. Choose pale pink walls, in either a plain paint or a floral wallpaper, and accent throughout the room with shimmering pale gold accessories, choosing cream or light wood furniture.

                Innocence, Natural - Roller Blind (247blinds)
                </h3></a><p class="sf-product-card-horizontal__description desktop-only truncate-overflow" data-v-338237a7>
                    A soft, neutral blind, patterned with simply drawn, off-white ferns, the innocence in natural is quiet and unassuming. The gently light-filtering material allows just the right amount of light through, whilst still offering all of the privacy you need. Cream-coloured kitchens with a light and airy feel will benefit from the natural, which will hang discreetly amongst both stronger colours and other neutrals, making it the ideal shade for those who prefer hushed, low-key hues without any risk of colour-clashing.

                    The osborne in natural adds a look of luxury and taste, without feeling lavish or over-the-top. The soft taupe patterning on a bed of light-filtering cream work together to bring together contemporary traditionalism and pretty comfort. The natural will sit comfortably in a number of colour schemes, the most notable being one of turquoises, aquas, and golds, which will suit a modern bedroom or living room in need of a refreshing dcor revival.

                    Woodland natural combines a simple and neutral on-trend colour with a unique texture to give an added layer of unexpected depth to your decor. It's these little touches that bring the fabric to life, and make you feel at home as soon as you put your key in the door. If you want to be able to turn on the style in the dining room, why not treat yourself to some slate flooring and a matching thick wooden topped table? These are the sort of rustic meets contemporary touches that woodland natural was made to hang by.

                    As you stand back and admire saphira natural, you come to appreciate the elegant way in which the colours have combined to create something that is very much greater than the sum of their parts. The clever use of calming greens and soothing blues really does give the fabric a life of its own. We love the idea of working in a powdery sunrise orange so that that you can turn the master bedroom into the space that greets you with a smile when you wake each morning.
