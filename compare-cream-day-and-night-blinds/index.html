          The Day &amp; Night Brushed Pearl roller blind will add both practicality and personality to your window. Its golden beige stripes give it a unique aesthetic, perfect for neutrally styled interiors. This is a great alternative to a traditional venetian blind and will look great in any window you put it in. Looking for something a little different?

Simply close or open the blind to move the strips to see out, or block yourself in. With their destinctive look, our Day &amp; Night blinds don't just look amazing, but will also give you control over the light entering your room. The unique 2 layered fabric gives this blind a look like no other. Coming from the cassette down, around a bottom bar and back up is what makes this blind work. All of our blinds are sold with built-in child safety mechanisms. We adhere to the guidelines set out by the British Blind and Shutter Association and take safety extremely seriously. All blinds come with the relevant child safety instructions and warnings. Please ensure you follow the provided instructions and warnings carefully.
