The fabric itself is a lightweight, linen-look cloth, creating the perfect plain canvas for this work of art. Temper deeper greys or richer browns in a contemporary living room by hanging the charcoal against a bold feature wall. Use more neutral creams and oatmeals for your sofas and carpets, and choose between brushed silver or tarnished gold for fittings and fixtures. Please note: roman blinds over 130cm wide require vertical seams due to limited fabric width. We recommended you split large windows into smaller blinds.","price":30.56,"paththumb":"1602971023198790.webp","category":"roman","colour":"grey","model":"meadow","site":"247blinds","categories":["grey","grey-meadow","grey-meadow-roman","grey-roman","meadow","meadow-roman","roman"]}]}},"context":{}}
