If ever there were a fabric made for the curves of the roman blind, this is the one. Try using the raspberry in a neutral cream or magnolia hallway to add a burst of colour to an often overlooked area of the home that can be much in need of a stylish lift.","price":33.27,"paththumb":"6858907368301007.webp","category":"roman","colour":"red","model":"windsor","site":"247blinds","categories":["red","windsor","roman","red-windsor","red-roman","windsor-roman"],"affiliate":{"link":"","value":0.71}},{"url":"https://www.247blinds.co.uk/windsor-red-roman-blind","title":"Windsor, Red - Roman Blind","description":"Vivid and vibrant, the windsor red simply refuses to be missed.
