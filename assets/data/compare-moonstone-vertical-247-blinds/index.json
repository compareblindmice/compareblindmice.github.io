The light, supple fabric is of the highest quality, and hangs in neat louvres for easy workability. The traditional room for such a natural material might be the kitchen, where it will undeniably look fantastic amongst hessian fabrics and woven wicker, but why not couple the moonstone with deep chocolate browns in a country living room instead? With this versatile fabric, you'll never run out of options.","price":25.12,"paththumb":"3666174949439567.webp","category":"vertical","colour":"grey","model":"moonstone","site":"247blinds","categories":["grey","moonstone","vertical","grey-moonstone","grey-vertical","moonstone-vertical"],"affiliate":{"link":"","value":0.71}}]}},"context":{}}
