Used to mellow the palettes of brightly coloured rooms, the antique steel is suitable for literally any room of the house. Keep your blinds looking their best with this easy to wipe clean fabric, just use a damp cloth to wipe away any dirt or stains.  This blind can be made upto 400cm wide - much wider than all other blinds on the market so that you can cover your largest window without comprimising on style. All of their blinds are sold with built-in child safety mechanisms. We adhere to the guidelines set out by the british blind and shutter association and take safety extremely seriously. All blinds come with the relevant child safety instructions and warnings. Please ensure you follow the provided instructions and warnings carefully. Please visit www.Makeitsafe.Org.Uk to find out more. All control chains supplied with their vertical blinds will be approximately half the length of the drop.
