The richness of the colour makes this a balancing force in rooms with strongly coloured furnishings, while the dimout fabric still allows some lightflow during the daytime, for a gentle softening effect. The perfect fit blind fits to the window frame itself as opposed to installing on the wall, making it a great choice for conservatories which often have little wall space.","price":68.99,"paththumb":"8120898262052717.webp","category":"perfect-fit","colour":"blue","model":"","site":"Make My Blinds","categories":["blue","perfect-fit","blue-perfect-fit"],"affiliate":{"link":"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=19309&awinaffid=826863&ued=https://www.makemyblinds.co.uk/kingston-royal-blue-pleated-perfect-fit.html","value":1.98}}]}},"context":{}}
