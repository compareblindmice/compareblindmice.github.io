This icy white hue covers the durable faux wood of the shutter flawlessly, and works wonderfully as any of their different style options: tier on tier, caf, or full height. Pair the vivid white with any colour scheme you like, but for a truly striking style, stick to an all-white theme in an open-plan kitchen. Think white walls, white units, white floor, white everything - the look will be bold and vivacious, and certainly hard to forget.","price":76.45,"paththumb":"1875451081338847.webp","category":"shutters-and","colour":"white","model":"daytona","site":"247blinds","categories":["white","white-daytona","white-daytona-shutters-and","white-shutters-and","daytona","daytona-shutters-and","shutters-and"]},{"url":"https://www.247blinds.co.uk/daytona-cool-white-plantation-shutter","title":"Daytona, Cool White - Plantation Shutter","description":"Available in three distinct yet equally lovely styles, the daytona cool white is neutral, calming, and stylish.
