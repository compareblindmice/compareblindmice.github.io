These naturally toned hues mean that this is a versatile blind that will work as part of a number of dcor schemes. The sandstone would work wonderfully as part of a neutral hallway or upstairs landing, or even in the downstairs cloakroom or utility.","price":30.29,"paththumb":"6061329975664543.webp","category":"roman","colour":"cream","model":"heritage","site":"247blinds","categories":["cream","cream-heritage","cream-heritage-roman","cream-roman","heritage","heritage-roman","roman"],"affiliate":{"link":"","value":0}}]}},"context":{}}
