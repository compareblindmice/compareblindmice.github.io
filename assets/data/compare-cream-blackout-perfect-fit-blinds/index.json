A stylish, blackout pleated blind produced with an asc, solar reflective, backing.","productdescription":"Part of their galaxy blackout range, where advanced solar control (asc) and blackout properties are combined to create a perfect solution for any room, whilst also increasing your energy efficiency. The asc refers to a reflective backing on the material which helps improve the energy efficiency of the blind by reflecting the heat out in the summer and retaining heat in the winter. The metallic reflective backing is therefore on the reverse of the fabric, facing towards the window. This perfect fit blind is produced in a single cell fabric and can be mounted in a 'no drill, no screws' fitting to most double glazed, internally beaded, upvc windows and doors. Blackout fabric: yes. Please note, on a perfect fit blind you may get light leakage between the material and frame. This is a single-cell fabric, the guide wires will be exposed meaning that there will be visible holes allowing light to come through. These can be seen on their range of images above. If you would prefer the wires to be hidden, please take a look at their 'hive' or 'luna' ranges.","price":20.75,"paththumb":"56788973861594.webp","category":"perfect-fit","colour":"cream","model":"blackout","site":"Blinds By Post","categories":["cream","cream-blackout","cream-blackout-perfect-fit","cream-perfect-fit","blackout","blackout-perfect-fit","perfect-fit"]},{"url":"https://www.kingstonblindsdirect.co.uk/product/perfect-fit-pleated-blind-halo-blackout-oyster/","title":"Perfect Fit Pleated Blind Halo Blackout Oyster","metadescription":"Perfect fit pleated blind halo blackout oyster available from leading blinds supplier kingston blinds direct.
