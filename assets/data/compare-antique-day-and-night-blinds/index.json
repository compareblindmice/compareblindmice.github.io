The result is, true to its name, a faintly antiqued effect that adds character and depth to an otherwise simple blind. The antique would look stunningly pretty against a vintage pink wall in the master or guest bedroom. Furnish the room with vintage woods to complement the brown in the blind and with sweet florals and antiqued linens for a gorgeously chic effect.","price":30.48,"paththumb":"3382580189065034.webp","category":"day-and-night","colour":"","model":"antique","site":"247blinds","categories":["antique","antique-day-and-night","day-and-night"]}]}},"context":{}}
