An antique cream base is home to sketched images of patterned and coloured beach huts, forming a cute and quirky artwork. Add to a beach-style bedroom alongside blues and creams, adding in some shabby chic accessories to continue the nautical effect. Plenty of wood furniture will match the scheme well and will bring out the brown tones in the blind.","price":30.29,"paththumb":"1713399500172853.webp","category":"roman","colour":"","model":"antique","site":"247blinds","categories":["antique","roman","antique-roman"],"affiliate":{"link":"","value":0.71}},{"url":"https://www.247blinds.co.uk/magnum-antique-day-night-blind","title":"Magnum, Antique - Day Night Blind","description":"The magnum in antique features a double-layered, creamy white fabric, gently interwoven with faint hints of coffee brown. The result is, true to its name, a faintly antiqued effect that adds character and depth to an otherwise simple blind. The antique would look stunningly pretty against a vintage pink wall in the master or guest bedroom. Furnish the room with vintage woods to complement the brown in the blind and with sweet florals and antiqued linens for a gorgeously chic effect.","price":30.48,"paththumb":"3382580189065034.webp","category":"day-and-night","colour":"","model":"antique","site":"247blinds","categories":["antique","day-and-night","antique-day-and-night"],"affiliate":{"link":"","value":0.71}},{"url":"https://www.247blinds.co.uk/windsor-antique-roman-blind","title":"Windsor, Antique - Roman Blind","description":"Camel gold, with gentle ribbing and a silky, flawless finish, the windsor antique offers quite an aesthetic. The smooth fabric blends beautifully into roman folds, stabilised with sewn in batons to prevent sagging and ensure that your blind will last you for years. Opt for a striking look in your master bedroom by setting the antique with a jet black shade. Pattern the walls with a gold and cream damask wallpaper, with hints of black, and choose black bedlinen and rugs, burnished with the occasional gold accent.","price":33.27,"paththumb":"6990497714860329.webp","category":"roman","colour":"","model":"antique","site":"247blinds","categories":["antique","roman","antique-roman"],"affiliate":{"link":"","value":0.71}}]}},"context":{}}
