The colour is not created in a block but rather created from a series of short strokes of mid-tone and darker greys, which layer into a deep grey fabric. Additional shading comes from the pleated ripples that create natural highlights and pooling shadows. The perfect fit blind fits to the window frame itself as opposed to installing on the wall, for tools-free installation in under 15 minutes.","price":68.99,"paththumb":"2733300932766835.webp","category":"perfect-fit","colour":"grey","model":"hampton","site":"Make My Blinds","categories":["grey","hampton","perfect-fit","grey-hampton","grey-perfect-fit","hampton-perfect-fit"],"affiliate":{"link":"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=19309&awinaffid=826863&ued=https://www.makemyblinds.co.uk/hampton-grey-pleated-perfect-fit.html","value":1.98}}]}},"context":{}}
