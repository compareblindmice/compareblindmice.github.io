Let the outside in, or keep it out, by adjusting the louvres accordingly. Set the dark purple against pale cream walls and bring the colour to life with occasional silver ornaments, frames, and fittings. Or instead, give your hallway or landing a boost of colour to add depth and intrigue to magnolia or beige walls.","price":20.15,"paththumb":"3452601255755701.webp","category":"vertical","colour":"purple","model":"origin","site":"247blinds","categories":["purple","purple-origin","purple-origin-vertical","purple-vertical","origin","origin-vertical","vertical"]}]}},"context":{}}
