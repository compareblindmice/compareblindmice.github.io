The shade works wonderfully with the soft sheerness of the slidable strips, which work to afford you light and privacy simultaneously. The ecru will temper bolder colours easily, without taking away from its own unique look. For an elegant feel in the master bedroom, sit the blind against an aubergine feature wall, and accent throughout with similar tones of cream and purple, using gold as a subtle trim.","price":30.45,"paththumb":"949337247868460.webp","category":"day-and-night","colour":"","model":"ecru","site":"247blinds","categories":["ecru","day-and-night","ecru-day-and-night"],"affiliate":{"link":"","value":0}},{"url":"https://www.247blinds.co.uk/capri-ecru-roman-blind","title":"Capri, Ecru - Roman Blind","description":"A multi-coloured delight, the capri ecru depicts gorgeous foliage in artistic brushstrokes of icy blues, aqua greens, sunny yellows, and more. This roman blind is both pretty and refreshing, perfect for both contemporary and traditional homes.
