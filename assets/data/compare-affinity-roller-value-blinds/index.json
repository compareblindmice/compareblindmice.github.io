The subtle glowing quality of the affinity plaster make this blind an ideal addition to a decadent yet tasteful bedroom or living room, where it couples well with traditional wooden features.","price":14.02,"paththumb":"4652384196536010.webp","category":"roller","colour":"","model":"affinity","site":"247blinds","categories":["affinity","roller","affinity-roller"],"affiliate":{"link":"","value":0.71}},{"slug":"roller-affinity-storm-blind","url":"https://www.247blinds.co.uk/affinity-storm-roller-blind","title":"Affinity Storm - Roller Blind","description":"The lightweight, easy-to-use affinity storm is comprised of a dark grey backdrop fabric covered with a high quality, stitched pattern that reduces the light coming in from outdoors without having the full influence of a blackout blind. The way that the pattern is stitched allows the affinity storm to gently shine, giving it a modern and chic quality. Try contrasting with dark blues or purples in the living room to provide a rich, opulent colour scheme, or use the affinity patterning to provide character in a much more colour-neutral hallway or landing.","price":14.02,"paththumb":"13396632950873.webp","category":"roller","colour":"","model":"affinity","site":"247blinds","categories":["affinity","roller","affinity-roller"],"affiliate":{"link":"","value":0.71}},{"slug":"roller-affinity-silver-blind","url":"https://www.247blinds.co.uk/affinity-silver-roller-blind","title":"Affinity Silver - Roller Blind","description":"The affinity in silver combines the distinctive affinity patterning with a barely-there silver fabric to provide a truly stunning interaction between room light and blind, making an ethereal addition to any home. This pretty fabric keeps out enough of the outside world to offer privacy, yet won't totally blackout a room. Couple the affinity silver with a dark navy for a moody yet beautiful bedroom colour scheme, or add a hint of sophistication to a monochrome dining room.","price":14.5,"paththumb":"4208245241955135.webp","category":"roller","colour":"grey","model":"affinity","site":"247blinds","categories":["grey","affinity","roller","grey-affinity","grey-roller","affinity-roller"],"affiliate":{"link":"","value":0.71}},{"slug":"roller-affinity-pure-blind","url":"https://www.247blinds.co.uk/affinity-pure-roller-blind","title":"Affinity Pure - Roller Blind","description":"The affinity pure takes a lightweight, easy-hanging white fabric with a subtle hint of cream, and uses it to host a pure white, modern pattern. The contrast between the stitching and fabric adds interest to an otherwise neutral blind. Use the affinity pure as part of a fresh, neutral colour scheme in a living room or home office. Or make a real feature of it, by setting it amongst brightly painted walls to make it really stand out in a colourful bedroom or playroom.","price":14.5,"paththumb":"6341113386775075.webp","category":"roller","colour":"white","model":"affinity","site":"247blinds","categories":["white","affinity","roller","white-affinity","white-roller","affinity-roller"],"affiliate":{"link":"","value":0.71}},{"slug":"roller-affinity-touch-blind","url":"https://www.247blinds.co.uk/affinity-touch-roller-blind","title":"Affinity Touch - Roller Blind","description":"If you're looking for an off-white, patterned blind that oozes class and sophistication, then the affinity touch could be the one you've been looking for.
