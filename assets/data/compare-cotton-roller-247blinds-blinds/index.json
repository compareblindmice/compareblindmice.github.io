The sturdy, durable fabric is also flexible and smooth, making for a high quality, easily usable blackout blind. Team the cotton with soft pastels and light woods for a light and airy kitchen, or with heavy greys and blacks for an industrial-look living room. You might even use it in the bedroom, where it would sit pretty amongst florals and checks.","price":14.02,"paththumb":"3319164591575978.webp","category":"roller","colour":"","model":"cotton","site":"247blinds","categories":["cotton","roller","cotton-roller"],"affiliate":{"link":"","value":0}}]}},"context":{}}
