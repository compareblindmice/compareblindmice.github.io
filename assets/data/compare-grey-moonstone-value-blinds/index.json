The grainy, woven fabric provides a blind that's built to last. Beige will match almost any dcor scheme, but the moonstone will look especially stylish in a contemporary country dining room, surrounded by deep browns and soft creams, or set against bolder reds in a cosy bedroom, where you can curl up and relax.","price":21.5,"paththumb":"7791576404107792.webp","category":"roller","colour":"grey","model":"moonstone","site":"247blinds","categories":["grey","moonstone","roller","grey-moonstone","grey-roller","moonstone-roller"],"affiliate":{"link":"","value":0}},{"url":"https://www.247blinds.co.uk/anthology-blackout-moonstone-roller-blind","title":"Anthology (Blackout), Moonstone - Roller Blind","description":"Moonstone from their anthology (blackout) range allows you to introduce a blend of white, beige, and grey to your colour scheme with the click of a button. Its intricate weave and clever patched style of colouring provides a depth and subtlety to proceedings that you perhaps weren't expecting. Take your decor down the contemporary meets country route by adding in some stencil signs on the walls, shabby chic furniture, and a little cracked leather for good measure.","price":24.16,"paththumb":"4448618113304917.webp","category":"roller","colour":"grey","model":"moonstone","site":"247blinds","categories":["grey","moonstone","roller","grey-moonstone","grey-roller","moonstone-roller"],"affiliate":{"link":"","value":0}},{"url":"https://www.247blinds.co.uk/anthology-moonstone-vertical-blind","title":"Anthology, Moonstone - Vertical Blind","description":"The purposeful style of the anthology in moonstone provides the best of both worlds with its gorgeous, woven texture and natural beige hue. The light, supple fabric is of the highest quality, and hangs in neat louvres for easy workability. The traditional room for such a natural material might be the kitchen, where it will undeniably look fantastic amongst hessian fabrics and woven wicker, but why not couple the moonstone with deep chocolate browns in a country living room instead? With this versatile fabric, you'll never run out of options.","price":25.12,"paththumb":"3666174949439567.webp","category":"vertical","colour":"grey","model":"moonstone","site":"247blinds","categories":["grey","moonstone","vertical","grey-moonstone","grey-vertical","moonstone-vertical"],"affiliate":{"link":"","value":0}}]}},"context":{}}
