The rimini's miami yellow is bright, funky, and summery. Due to its lightweight but sturdy fabric, it has a surprising level of opaqueness, despite its light colour. Not that you'll notice, with the colour of sunshine in your window. This is the ideal hue for creating a sunny, cheery kitchen, or a fun, energetic home office. Pair with creams and pretty florals for some country chic, or with sky blue shades for a fun, summery feel.","price":7.39,"paththumb":"3415780360819503.webp","category":"roller","colour":"yellow","model":"rimini","site":"247blinds","categories":["yellow","rimini","roller","yellow-rimini","yellow-roller","rimini-roller"],"affiliate":{"link":"","value":0.71}}]}},"context":{}}
