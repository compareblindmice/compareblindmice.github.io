Pair in with a neon theme to really make this blind pop! There isn't much else we can say about this colour other than how vibrant and green it is, it is a blackout fabric so would also work in a bedroom and prevent any light from passing through the fabric itself. Keep your blinds looking their best with this easy to wipe clean fabric, just use a damp cloth to wipe away any dirt or stains.  This blind can be made upto 400cm wide - much wider than all other blinds on the market so that you can cover your largest window without comprimising on style.
