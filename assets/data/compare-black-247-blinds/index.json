The fabric falls beautifully into the soft curves of the blind, forming a look of character and depth. Modern style can be just as luxurious as traditional, so create a sumptuous monochrome mode in the living room by teaming the black with soft white walls, dove grey furnishings, and silver finishings.","price":37.64,"paththumb":"6942760957735974.webp","category":"roman","colour":"black","model":"","site":"247blinds","categories":["black","roman","black-roman"],"affiliate":{"link":"","value":0.71}},{"slug":"roof-roller-4069-black-velux-loft-blind","url":"https://www.247blinds.co.uk/roller-4069-black-velux-loft-blind","title":"Roller 4069 Black - Velux Loft Blind","description":"Softens the incoming light.
