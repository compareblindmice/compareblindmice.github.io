The simple, smooth texture of the fabric creates easily movable louvres, which can be adjusted at will to allow as much or as little light in as you like. Use in a chic, contemporary home office with plenty of whites or creams, and the occasional hint of silver every now and again.","price":18.85,"paththumb":"8410822584156979.webp","category":"vertical","colour":"cream","model":"origin","site":"247blinds","categories":["cream","cream-origin","cream-origin-vertical","cream-vertical","origin","origin-vertical","vertical"]},{"url":"https://www.247blinds.co.uk/origin-blackout-oyster-vertical-blind","title":"Origin (Blackout), Oyster - Vertical Blind","description":"The oyster blind, from the origin (blackout) range, is subtlety at its best. The soft cream fabric radiates luxurious sophistication, whilst still maintaining a confident neutrality that helps it to match almost any colour. For a country, shaker-style kitchen, sit the oyster amongst matching cream units, with wooden worktops and rustic furniture, accompanied by pretty florals and vintage-style appliances.","price":20.15,"paththumb":"5364342894988614.webp","category":"vertical","colour":"cream","model":"origin","site":"247blinds","categories":["cream","cream-origin","cream-origin-vertical","cream-vertical","origin","origin-vertical","vertical"]},{"url":"https://www.247blinds.co.uk/origin-blackout-oyster-grey-vertical-blind","title":"Origin (Blackout), Oyster Grey - Vertical Blind","description":"So subtle in colour that it's barely there, the origin (blackout) in oyster grey offers just a hint of colour to blend in beautifully with existing dcor. Despite its understated texture and hue, this is a mighty blackout blind, ideal for blocking out the outside light.
