Choose an unusual colour scheme of blue and white for your kitchen, keeping the main items of flooring, walls, tiling, and units in these two colours. Then add an accent colour, perhaps yellow, lime, or orange, to bring the room to life.","price":29.28,"paththumb":"1206532712193442.webp","category":"roman","colour":"purple","model":"nordic","site":"247blinds","categories":["purple","purple-nordic","purple-nordic-roman","purple-roman","nordic","nordic-roman","roman"],"affiliate":{"link":"","value":0}}]}},"context":{}}
