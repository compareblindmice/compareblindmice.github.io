Bold and memorable, this blind is almost opaque, yet doesn't block out the light entirely, making for a great compromise. Don't be shy; use the thunderbird as a central feature in your white or cream kitchen, or go bold in the bathroom by opting for a non-traditional colour scheme of red and white. Or you might find that this daring red provides you with all the motivation you need in your home office.","price":10.15,"paththumb":"1449635496819858.webp","category":"roller","colour":"","model":"thunder","site":"247blinds","categories":["thunder","roller","thunder-roller"],"affiliate":{"link":"","value":0.71}},{"url":"https://www.247blinds.co.uk/prism-thunder-roller-blind","title":"Prism, Thunder - Roller Blind","description":"Prism thunder combines a cheery and welcoming style of printing with a slightly colder and more distant colour scheme. The end result is a design that welcomes you through the door before slowing things down and taking the edge off. The light blues make this the perfect addition to the master bedroom so that you can switch off and begin to wind down. It's all about adding in other slightly faded colours like greens and browns.","price":24.99,"paththumb":"506413060147454.webp","category":"roller","colour":"","model":"thunder","site":"247blinds","categories":["thunder","roller","thunder-roller"],"affiliate":{"link":"","value":0.71}},{"url":"https://www.247blinds.co.uk/neo-thunder-roller-blind","title":"Neo, Thunder - Roller Blind","description":"The neo thunder is a grey-blue, ornately patterned filter blind that is sure to add something a little different to your home.
