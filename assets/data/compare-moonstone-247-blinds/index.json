The grainy, woven fabric provides a blind that's built to last. Beige will match almost any dcor scheme, but the moonstone will look especially stylish in a contemporary country dining room, surrounded by deep browns and soft creams, or set against bolder reds in a cosy bedroom, where you can curl up and relax.","price":21.5,"paththumb":"7791576404107792.webp","category":"roller","colour":"grey","model":"moonstone","site":"247blinds","categories":["grey","moonstone","roller","grey-moonstone","grey-roller","moonstone-roller"],"affiliate":{"link":"","value":0}},{"url":"https://www.247blinds.co.uk/anthology-blackout-moonstone-roller-blind","title":"Anthology (Blackout), Moonstone - Roller Blind","description":"Moonstone from their anthology (blackout) range allows you to introduce a blend of white, beige, and grey to your colour scheme with the click of a button.

The light, supple fabric is of the highest quality, and hangs in neat louvres for easy workability. The traditional room for such a natural material might be the kitchen, where it will undeniably look fantastic amongst hessian fabrics and woven wicker, but why not couple the moonstone with deep chocolate browns in a country living room instead? With this versatile fabric, you'll never run out of options.","price":25.12,"paththumb":"3666174949439567.webp","category":"vertical","colour":"grey","model":"moonstone","site":"247blinds","categories":["grey","moonstone","vertical","grey-moonstone","grey-vertical","moonstone-vertical"],"affiliate":{"link":"","value":0}}]}},"context":{}}
