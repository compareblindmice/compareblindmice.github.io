When curved into the tempered arches of the roman, the pattern takes on a new, more scattered vibe, providing the look with character and personality. Hang the pistachio in your home workspace or art studio, where the soft colours will both calm and inspire. Choosing a matching vintage blue to create a feature wall, scatter plenty of matching pistachio and mustard fabrics and cushions throughout the space for a fun but coordinated look.

The softness of the roman style only adds to this rural feel, and the fabric is backed with a fade-protective lining to make this blind last. The magenta will work beautifully as part of a traditional bedroom scheme in a country cottage or manor. Keep the base colours neutral and use the pinks and purples in wall hangings and bedlinen to accentuate their place in the blind.
