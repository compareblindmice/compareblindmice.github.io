Versatile in more way than one, the natural can be used in almost any colour scheme. Why not use it in the dining room amidst a rich sky blue for a natural look that brings the outdoors in? Opt for light woods to match the blind, and include plenty of blues and whites for light and character.","price":30.48,"paththumb":"6319290301612230.webp","category":"day-and-night","colour":"","model":"natural","site":"247blinds","categories":["natural","day-and-night","natural-day-and-night"],"affiliate":{"link":"","value":0.71}}]}},"context":{}}
