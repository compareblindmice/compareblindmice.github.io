Either of these would be the perfect look for the living room or dining room in a contemporary, stylish home.","price":7.39,"paththumb":"6620203360557188.webp","category":"roller","colour":"beige","model":"rimini","site":"247blinds","categories":["beige","beige-rimini","beige-rimini-roller","beige-roller","rimini","rimini-roller","roller"]},{"url":"https://www.247blinds.co.uk/rimini-blackout-sand-roller-blind","title":"Rimini (Blackout), Sand - Roller Blind","description":"The rimini (blackout) in sand is a stylish, light, and vibrant blackout blind with a subtle, patterned texture.
