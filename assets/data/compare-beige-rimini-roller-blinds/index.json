Its light translucency means that plenty of light penetrates it, even when closed, so you'll never be lacking in sunshine. Pair sand with navy blues and light-coloured woods for a modern look with a unique twist, or with browns, greens, and golds for something classic and luxurious. Either of these would be the perfect look for the living room or dining room in a contemporary, stylish home.","price":7.39,"paththumb":"6620203360557188.webp","category":"roller","colour":"beige","model":"rimini","site":"247blinds","categories":["beige","rimini","roller","beige-rimini","beige-roller","rimini-roller"],"affiliate":{"link":"","value":0.71}}]}},"context":{}}
