The look is cool, calm, and collected, and will look fantastic in a range of colour schemes. Go bold or go home by adding the noir to a lime, black, and white colour scheme in your home office. Paint a feature wall in zesty lime, and opt for black and white furniture with clean lines and a modern finish, using lime to accent with cushions, throws, and wall art.","price":30.29,"paththumb":"1750863452096039.webp","category":"roman","colour":"black","model":"nordic","site":"247blinds","categories":["black","black-nordic","black-nordic-roman","black-roman","nordic","nordic-roman","roman"],"affiliate":{"link":"","value":0}}]}},"context":{}}
