Raised ribbing catches the light further, increasing the feeling of texture and character to the blind. Use the black in a contemporary setting, teaming it with a boldly patterned wallpaper in shimmering silvers. Pick a sumptuous purple or a luxe forest green to use as your accents, placing them throughout the room in the form of cushions, lamps, and ornaments.","price":33.27,"paththumb":"3785676059443566.webp","category":"roman","colour":"black","model":"windsor","site":"247blinds","categories":["black","black-windsor","black-windsor-roman","black-roman","windsor","windsor-roman","roman"],"affiliate":{"link":"","value":0}}]}},"context":{}}
