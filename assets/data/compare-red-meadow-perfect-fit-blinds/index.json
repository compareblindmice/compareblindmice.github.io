The asc refers to a reflective backing on the material which helps improve the energy efficiency of the blind by reflecting the heat out in the summer and retaining heat in the winter. The metallic reflective backing is therefore on the reverse of the fabric, facing towards the window. This perfect fit blind is produced in a single cell fabric and can be mounted in a 'no drill, no screws' fitting to most double glazed, internally beaded, upvc windows and doors. This is a single-cell fabric, the guide wires will be exposed meaning that there will be visible holes allowing light to come through. These can be seen on their range of images above. If you would prefer the wires to be hidden, please take a look at their 'hive' or 'luna' ranges.","price":20.75,"paththumb":"8645159120329677.webp","category":"perfect-fit","colour":"red","model":"meadow","site":"Blinds By Post","categories":["red","red-meadow","red-meadow-perfect-fit","red-perfect-fit","meadow","meadow-perfect-fit","perfect-fit"]}]}},"context":{}}
