When the sun is out, and the blind is open, they will serve only to accent each other, creating a gorgeous glow in your home. The yellow will work best with other pastels, or with whites, and can be used to add a subtle infusion of warm colour to an otherwise neutral room. Choose it for your home office or entry hallway for a distinctly pretty flush of colour.","price":19.5,"paththumb":"7204442876987127.webp","category":"vertical","colour":"yellow","model":"blackout","site":"247blinds","categories":["yellow","yellow-blackout","yellow-blackout-vertical","yellow-vertical","blackout","blackout-vertical","vertical"]}]}},"context":{}}
