The pale colour is modern and in vogue, reminiscent of the clean hues of scandinavian dcor, and the hardy fabric holds its own and controls the light. Blended with whites, blacks, and darker greys, this blind creates a fresh, clean look, yet is equally as effective when used as a neutral amongst bold reds, bright oranges and yellows, or deep, rich purples.","price":10.85,"paththumb":"1738184746118040.webp","category":"roller","colour":"","model":"","site":"247blinds","categories":["roller"],"affiliate":{"link":"","value":0.71}},{"url":"https://www.247blinds.co.uk/roma-gallery-roller-blind","title":"Roma, Gallery - Roller Blind","description":"Not quite white, but without the muted feel of cream, the roma gallery is a beautifully understated blind.
