With such a dark neutral colour, we highly recommend pairing it with a brighter decor, preferably pastel primary colours that add an accent but don't try to beat the Rock in a contest of strength, which they would most likely lose. Alternatively, used it to bridge a monochromatic scheme and take the edge out of the white/black contrast. Keep your blinds looking their best with this easy to wipe clean fabric. Just use a damp cloth to wipe away any dirt or stains. These blinds are moisture resistant too so can be installed in a kitchen or bathroom. Fed up of the sun spoiling your view of the telly? Install this dimout blind and stop the glare from ruinning your favourite show.  All of our blinds are sold with built-in child safety mechanisms. We adhere to the guidelines set out by the British Blind and Shutter Association and take safety extremely seriously. All blinds come with the relevant child safety instructions and warnings. Please ensure you follow the provided instructions and warnings carefully. Please visit www.makeitsafe.org.uk to find out more. All control chains supplied with our roller blinds will be approximately half the length of the drop. If you require a longer control chain, please get in touch once ordered and we can amend this for you.
