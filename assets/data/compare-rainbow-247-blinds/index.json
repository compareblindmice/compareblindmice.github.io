A contemporary and somewhat abstract floral pattern displays rose pinks, sunshine yellows, and citrus oranges, as well as apple greens and petrol blues, forming a plethora of colour across the canvas. Use the rainbow in any room where you want to make a statement. A room with plenty of sunlight will complement this blind best, and surround it with similar sunny yellow and oranges for a cheery, uplifting look.","price":33.49,"paththumb":"2868019681840350.webp","category":"roman","colour":"","model":"rainbow","site":"247blinds","categories":["rainbow","roman","rainbow-roman"],"affiliate":{"link":"","value":0.71}},{"slug":"roman-harper-rainbow-blind","url":"https://www.247blinds.co.uk/harper-rainbow-roman-blind","title":"Harper Rainbow - Roman Blind","description":"With a rainbow of colour and an explosion of shades that give this offering from the harper range its name you'll be able to add something enticing and eclectic to your interior. The real depth stems from the intriguing contrast between the zesty oranges and calmer pinks. A light blue feature wall and a light brown laminate floor are great ways to introduce this symphony of colour into the living room.","price":34.59,"paththumb":"3890821243183440.webp","category":"roman","colour":"","model":"rainbow","site":"247blinds","categories":["rainbow","roman","rainbow-roman"],"affiliate":{"link":"","value":0.71}}]}},"context":{}}
