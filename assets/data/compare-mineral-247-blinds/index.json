The ornately drawn leaves add a pretty touch, whilst the monkeys have a sense of fun and character. Use the mineral to give your downstairs cloakroom a colourful lift, going for a vibrant turquoise feature wall if you dare, and keeping the remainder of the room painted white.","price":31.3,"paththumb":"850200507704402.webp","category":"roman","colour":"","model":"mineral","site":"247blinds","categories":["mineral","roman","mineral-roman"],"affiliate":{"link":"","value":0.71}}]}},"context":{}}
