The way in which the colours make their own way across the fabric reminds the eye of the free-flowing beauty of watercolour masterpieces. When you want to work shadow into your dcor it pays to keep things simple. Find a matching scatter cushion cover or throw for the end of the bed and keep the rest of your dcor neutral. That way you'll be able to let the art really come to the fore. Please note: roman blinds over 130cm wide require vertical seams due to limited fabric width. We recommended you split large windows into smaller blinds.","price":30.29,"paththumb":"2758553945935292.webp","category":"roman","colour":"grey","model":"shadow","site":"247blinds","categories":["grey","grey-shadow","grey-shadow-roman","grey-roman","shadow","shadow-roman","roman"]}]}},"context":{}}
