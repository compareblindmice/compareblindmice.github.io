When curved into the tempered arches of the roman, the pattern takes on a new, more scattered vibe, providing the look with character and personality. Hang the pistachio in your home workspace or art studio, where the soft colours will both calm and inspire. Choosing a matching vintage blue to create a feature wall, scatter plenty of matching pistachio and mustard fabrics and cushions throughout the space for a fun but coordinated look. Please note: roman blinds over 130cm wide require vertical seams due to limited fabric width. We recommended you split large windows into smaller blinds.","price":29.55,"paththumb":"8408349796419960.webp","category":"roman","colour":"green","model":"meadow","site":"247blinds","categories":["green","green-meadow","green-meadow-roman","green-roman","meadow","meadow-roman","roman"]}]}},"context":{}}
