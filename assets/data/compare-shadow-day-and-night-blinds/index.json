The dark grey colour is versatile and can be paired in a variety of ways. Its a perfect addition to any window. Looking for something a little different? The alternating fabric strips give these blinds the privacy of a dimout blind, but also the transparency of a voile blind. Simply close or open the blind to move the strips to see out, or block yourself in. With their destinctive look, their day & night blinds don't just look amazing, but will also give you control over the light entering your room. The unique 2 layered fabric gives this blind a look like no other. Coming from the cassette down, around a bottom bar and back up is what makes this blind work.
