Part of our Infusion asc range, where Advanced Solar Control (asc) creates a perfect solution for any room, reducing the sun's glare whilst also increasing your energy efficiency. The ‘ASC’ refers to a reflective backing on the material which helps improve the energy efficiency of the blind by reflecting the heat out in the Summer and retaining heat in the Winter. The metallic reflective backing is therefore on the reverse of the fabric, facing towards the window.  This fabric will still allow light into the room, but giving full privacy when inside from outside. This perfect fit blind is produced in a single cell fabric and can be mounted in a 'no drill, no screws' fitting to most double glazed, internally beaded, uPVC windows and doors. The blind is fixed by brackets which sit between the black rubber bead and the glass, they simply slide in when installing - taking minutes per blind to fit and keeping the window guarantee!  This is a single-cell fabric, the guide wires will be exposed meaning that there will be visible holes allowing light to come through. These can be seen on our range of images above.  If you would prefer the wires to be hidden, please take a look at our 'Hive' or 'Luna' ranges.   Made to measure Infusion ASC Muted Gold Perfect Fit Pleated Blind PX4128.
