                    The origin in basic white is made from heavy gauge aluminium guaranteed not to sag. Its wipe-clean practicality combined with the pure white, satin look finish make this blind an attractive option that is pleasing in both looks and functionality. If it's a fresh, clean style that you're looking for, blend the basic white with an all-white colour palette that's perfect for the bathroom or kitchen.

                    The queen of neutrality, the magnolia version of their origin aluminium range is a simple choice that will match almost any colour it's paired with. Its satin finish and colour-coordinated cords provide it with a streamlined look that only the best of neutrals can achieve. If you love colour-blocking and continuation, go as far as setting the magnolia amongst matching magnolia walls, resulting in a clean, aerodynamic feel in a living room, hallway, or kitchen.

                    Don't be put off by the colour black's reputation; the origin in black is much more versatile, and can be far less moody, than you might think. Paired with the right dcor, the gloss aluminium slats and coordinated fittings can look simple and sophisticated. Set the black against white walls in a modern living room and complement with bright limes or fruity oranges for a step away from monochromatic living and towards boldness and colour.

                    The ultra-metallic brushed silver from the origin range is the height of utilitarian style. With a polished, near-matte finish, the blind's aluminium slats are sturdy and hardwearing, and easily controlled using the colour-matched cords that hang from the sides. The beauty of the brushed silver is that it can be used as part of a room's central colour scheme, or incorporated as a simple accent, in the same way as a fixture or fitting might.

                    Dark slate in colour, the origin grey is comprised of satin-finish, heavy gauge aluminium slats, high quality pull-cords, and a clear wand tilt, resulting in a streamlined, contemporary blind. Given that the grey shade will match a multitude of hues, this is an obvious choice for those who like to change their dcor often. Go industrial in the kitchen by pairing the grey with worn metals, rustic woods, and slate floor tiles.

                Origin, Ultramarine - Venetian Blind (247blinds)
                </h3></a><p class="sf-product-card-horizontal__description desktop-only truncate-overflow" data-v-6273ffba>
                    The origin ultra marine is a stand-out blue blind, with a gloss finish on strong aluminium slats. Made from only high quality materials, from the slats right through to the pull-cords, this blind is made for durability and hardiness. Take your bathroom to the seaside by coupling with pale, icy blues and pure, bright whites; or give a plain, neutral hallway or utility room a big splash of dazzling colour, offset by whites and silvers in ornaments, frames, and fittings.
