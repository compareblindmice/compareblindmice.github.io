The unique 2 layered fabric gives this blind a look like no other. Coming from the cassette down, around a bottom bar and back up is what makes this blind work. All of their blinds are sold with built-in child safety mechanisms. We adhere to the guidelines set out by the british blind and shutter association and take safety extremely seriously. All blinds come with the relevant child safety instructions and warnings. Please ensure you follow the provided instructions and warnings carefully.
